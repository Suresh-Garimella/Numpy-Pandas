# Numpy-Pandas
This repos give the basic understanding of numpy and pandas library in python

What is NumPy?
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

What is the purpose of NumPy?
Numpy is one of the most commonly used packages for scientific computing in Python. It provides a multidimensional array object, as well as variations such as masks and matrices, which can be used for various math operations.


Is NumPy a standard Python library?
It is a third-party library (i.e. it is not part of Python's standard library) that facilitates numerical computing in Python by providing users with a versatile N-dimensional array object for storing data, and powerful mathematical functions for operating on those arrays of numbers.

What is pandas?
pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.

What is pandas in Python used for?
Pandas is a Python library. Pandas is used to analyze data.

What is the purpose of pandas?
pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.
